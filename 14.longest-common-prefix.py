# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of
# strings.
# 
# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]

# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= strs.length <= 200
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
# strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
